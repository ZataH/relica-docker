If you like it please consider signing up with my [referral link](https://relicabackup.com/download?refid=0221c7a3-ffd0-4d1a-91b6-1cf6999f99fd).

Relica is designed to be run on your local machine and there are a number of challenges to running it remotely, which this container aims to solve.

This container, if properly configured, is suitable to run on NAS or other remote machines.


## Features:

* Automatically download the latest version when the container is started.
* Suitable for local usage on http://localhost:1201 or remote usage on :1301
* Configurable User and Group (to avoid permissions issues when using host filesystems)
* HTTP Basic Auth (optional)
* Automatic HTTPS for domain names, if used (via Caddy)
